    <h2>Detailed Explanation</h2>
    <p>
        In this exercise, we are learning how to separate structure and style in web design.
        HTML provides the structure and content, while CSS controls the visual presentation.
        By adjusting margins, fonts, and colors, we can create a well-formatted and readable
        web page layout that looks both simple and professional.
